# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Trends
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset, which consists of 284,807 transactions made by European cardholders in 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 492 fraud cases (0.17%), making fraud detection a challenging task.
